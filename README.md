# Single-Page-Application
A Single Page Application (SPA) dynamically updates content within a single page, offering faster navigation and seamless user experience without full-page reloads. Platforms like Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart use SPAs with JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular for responsive, real-time interactions and improved performance.
